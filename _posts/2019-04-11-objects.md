## Data objects and how they relate to each other

Computation can viewed as data objects being transfomed into other data objects. Here by a data object, we refer to arbitrary chunk of data. 

Data objects may contain data structures, assets.

KolmoLD specifies a special kind of data objects that can contain arbitrary algorithms: kolmoblocks. The alogirthms are encoded in a  Webassembly-based bytecode format.
